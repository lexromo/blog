      <description>Hey everyone, gather around for a cautionary tale from the digital frontier. Today, I want to share a recent experience that left me both startled and enlightened about the dangers lurking in the depths of our mobile devices: a job offer text phishing scam.
Imagine this: I&amp;rsquo;m going about my day, minding my own business as usuall, when suddenly, my phone buzzes with an incoming text message. Expecting it to be yet another notification from a friend or a reminder about an upcoming appointment, I casually glance at the screen, only to be met with a message that sends my heart racing.</description>

      <description>As I moved from an intern to a permanent role at my workplace, I was excited about the opportunity to contribute in a more significant way. Yet, as I settled into my new position, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice a glaring gap in our organization&amp;rsquo;s defenses: the lack of a structured cybersecurity architecture. Having studied cybersecurity intensively during my time at university, I understood the critical importance of addressing this issue to protect our digital assets.</description>

      <description>Split hard drive to install linux: Splitting a hard drive to install Linux refers to the process of dividing the storage space on a physical hard drive into multiple partitions or sections, with the intention of dedicating one or more of these partitions specifically for installing a Linux operating system.
When you split a hard drive to install Linux, you typically allocate a portion of the disk space to be used exclusively by the Linux operating system, its associated files, and possibly additional partitions for purposes like swap space or separate home directories.</description>

      <description>Encryption and Decryption Python Script: I wanted to share with you the project I recently completed for our university course, which involved creating a Python script for encryption and decryption. This project was a fascinating exploration into the world of cryptography and programming, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to tell you more about it.
First and foremost, cryptography plays a crucial role in securing sensitive information in today&amp;rsquo;s digital age. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s protecting personal communications, securing financial transactions, or safeguarding sensitive data, encryption serves as a vital tool for ensuring confidentiality and privacy.</description>

      <description>DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES! Phishing is a form of cybercrime that involves attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
Engaging in such activities is against the law and violates ethical standards. It&amp;rsquo;s important to use your cybersecurity knowledge and skills to protect and secure systems, data, and individuals from cyber threats, rather than using them for malicious purposes.</description>

      <description>AWS Here I create a Root user, I activated MFA to enhance the security of our AWS account. I activated the IAM because by default it is deactivated, and finally I activated and created a budget, so AWS can let us know when we are reaching our max budget.
In Amazon Web Services (AWS): The &amp;ldquo;root user&amp;rdquo; refers to the initial administrative user account created when you first set up an AWS account.</description>
