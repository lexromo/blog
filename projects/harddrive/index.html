This partitioning scheme allows you to have a dual-boot setup, where you can choose between booting into Linux or another operating system, such as Windows, if it’s also installed on the same hard drive.\nHere’s a basic overview of the steps I used before splitting my hard drive to install Linux: 1. Backup Data: Before partitioning your hard drive, it’s crucial to back up any important data to prevent accidental loss during the partitioning process.\n2. Partitioning Tool: Use a partitioning tool to create new partitions on the hard drive. Popular partitioning tools include GParted (available as a standalone application or included in many Linux distributions) and the partitioning tools provided by operating system installers.\n3. Allocate Space: Decide how much space you want to allocate for the Linux installation. This typically involves creating at least one partition for the root filesystem (/) and optionally additional partitions for swap space, the /home directory, or other purposes.\n4. Install Linux: Once the partitions are created, proceed with installing Linux on the designated partition(s). During the installation process, you’ll be prompted to choose the partition(s) where you want to install the Linux operating system.\n5. Boot Loader Configuration: After installation, configure the boot loader (such as GRUB or systemd-boot) to allow you to choose between booting into Linux or another operating system when you start your computer.\nBy splitting your hard drive to install Linux, you can enjoy the benefits of running Linux alongside another operating system on the same machine. This setup provides flexibility and allows you to take advantage of the features and capabilities offered by both operating systems. Additionally, it’s a common approach for individuals who want to experiment with Linux without fully committing to it as their primary operating system.\nWhy did I decide to split my HD to install Linux: Hey everyone,\nI recently decided to split my computer’s hard drive to install Linux, and I wanted to share why I made this choice.\nFirstly, Linux offers incredible customization and flexibility that I couldn’t find in other operating systems. By splitting my hard drive and dedicating a portion of it to Linux, I’m able to explore this world of customization in depth.
