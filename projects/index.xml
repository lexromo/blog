      <description>DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES! Phishing is a form of cybercrime that involves attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
Engaging in such activities is against the law and violates ethical standards. It&amp;rsquo;s important to use your cybersecurity knowledge and skills to protect and secure systems, data, and individuals from cyber threats, rather than using them for malicious purposes.</description>
