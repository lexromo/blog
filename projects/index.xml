      <description>split hard drive to install linux: Splitting a hard drive to install Linux refers to the process of dividing the storage space on a physical hard drive into multiple partitions or sections, with the intention of dedicating one or more of these partitions specifically for installing a Linux operating system.
When you split a hard drive to install Linux, you typically allocate a portion of the disk space to be used exclusively by the Linux operating system, its associated files, and possibly additional partitions for purposes like swap space or separate home directories.</description>

      <description>DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES! Phishing is a form of cybercrime that involves attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
Engaging in such activities is against the law and violates ethical standards. It&amp;rsquo;s important to use your cybersecurity knowledge and skills to protect and secure systems, data, and individuals from cyber threats, rather than using them for malicious purposes.</description>

      <description>AWS Here I create a Root user, I activated MFA to enhance the security of our AWS account. I activated the IAM because by default it is deactivated, and finally I activated and created a budget, so AWS can let us know when we are reaching our max budget.
In Amazon Web Services (AWS): The &amp;ldquo;root user&amp;rdquo; refers to the initial administrative user account created when you first set up an AWS account.</description>

      <description>Encryption and Decryption Python Script: I wanted to share with you the project I recently completed for our university course, which involved creating a Python script for encryption and decryption. This project was a fascinating exploration into the world of cryptography and programming, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to tell you more about it.
First and foremost, cryptography plays a crucial role in securing sensitive information in today&amp;rsquo;s digital age. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s protecting personal communications, securing financial transactions, or safeguarding sensitive data, encryption serves as a vital tool for ensuring confidentiality and privacy.</description>
