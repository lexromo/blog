# Introduction
In today’s digital age, staying connected has become a vital part of our daily lives. From keeping in touch with loved ones to managing finances, many aspects of life now involve technology. However, as our online presence increases, so do the risks of cyber threats, such as scams, phishing attacks, and identity theft. Older adults, in particular, are often more vulnerable to these threats due to a lack of familiarity with the latest security practices and technologies.

Cybercriminals often target older individuals because they may be less aware of the sophisticated tactics used to exploit personal information. Without proper knowledge, they are at risk of falling victim to fraud, which can result in financial loss, compromised privacy, and emotional distress. Therefore, raising cybersecurity awareness among older adults is crucial to protecting their safety and well-being in the digital world.

By providing practical cybersecurity education, we can empower older adults to recognize and defend against online risks, ensuring they can enjoy the benefits of technology safely. From identifying suspicious emails to setting strong passwords, simple but effective practices can make a significant difference in keeping them secure.
## Mom got a phishing attack 
Last week, my mom experienced something no one wants to go through—a phishing attack by telephone that cost her over a thousand dollars. Like many older adults, she wasn’t aware of what phishing was or how scammers manipulate people into revealing sensitive information. Here’s her story, and what we all can learn from it.

It all started with a phone call from someone claiming to be from her bank. The caller, who sounded calm and professional, told her that there had been a suspicious transaction on her account. He said that to cancel the fraudulent transaction, he needed her credit card details for verification. My mom, understandably worried about her finances, trusted the caller. After all, he was supposedly helping her protect her money, so she provided her credit card information without hesitation.

What she didn’t know was that the caller was a scammer. Within minutes of giving her details, $1,000 had been withdrawn from her account. By the time she realized what had happened, it was too late. She contacted the bank, but they informed her that because she had willingly provided her card information, there was nothing they could do to recover the money. It was a devastating blow, both financially and emotionally.

This experience was a hard lesson for all of us. We realized that scammers prey on people’s fears, urgency, and trust, and that anyone—regardless of age or experience—can fall victim. The fact that the bank wouldn’t cover the loss made it even more frustrating, highlighting how crucial it is to stay vigilant and aware of these types of scams.

## There are important lessons to take away from this:

**First,** never provide personal information over the phone unless you are absolutely certain of the caller’s identity. 

**Banks will never ask** for sensitive details like your credit card number or password over the phone. 

**Always verify** suspicious calls by hanging up and contacting the bank directly using a known, trusted number. Finally, it’s essential to educate our loved ones, especially older adults who may not be as familiar with cyber threats, about the warning signs of phishing and other scams.

My mom’s story is a reminder that we all need to be more cautious, and that cybersecurity awareness isn’t just about technology—it’s about protecting ourselves and our loved ones from falling victim to schemes that can have lasting consequences.

### Hosting a Cybersecurity Workshop for My Mom and Her Friends: Teaching the Basics of Phishing Attacks

After my mom fell victim to a phishing attack and lost a significant amount of money, I realized just how vulnerable older adults can be to cybercriminals. The experience was a wake-up call, not only for my mom but for me as well. I knew I had to do something to raise awareness and help her—and others like her—protect themselves from these kinds of scams. That’s why I decided to create a small workshop focused on teaching the basics of phishing attacks.

I gathered my mom and a few of her friends and held a session where we talked about what phishing attacks are, how they work, and most importantly, how to spot them. We discussed the common signs of phishing, like unexpected emails or phone calls asking for personal information, requests for immediate action, and suspicious links. I also made sure to emphasize that legitimate companies, especially banks, will never ask for sensitive information like passwords or credit card details over the phone or through email.

During the workshop, we went over real-life examples of phishing messages and practiced identifying the red flags. We also talked about the emotional manipulation scammers often use, such as creating a sense of urgency or fear to push victims into making hasty decisions. The goal was to equip everyone with the knowledge and confidence to handle these situations if they encountered them in the future.

At the end of the session, I shared some practical tips for staying safe online, like never giving out personal information over the phone, double-checking the sender’s email address before clicking on any links, and always contacting the company directly if something feels suspicious. It was great to see how engaged everyone was, and I could tell that they walked away with a much better understanding of how to protect themselves from phishing attacks.

This experience reinforced my belief that cybersecurity education is essential, especially for older adults who may not be as familiar with the risks of the digital world. A little bit of knowledge can go a long way in preventing someone from falling victim to these harmful scams. If you have older family members or friends, I encourage you to take the time to teach them about phishing and other online threats. It’s a small step that can make a big difference in keeping them safe.
