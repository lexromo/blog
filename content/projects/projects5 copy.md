# Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital age, staying connected has become a vital part of our daily lives. From keeping in touch with loved ones to managing finances, many aspects of life now involve technology. However, as our online presence increases, so do the risks of cyber threats, such as scams, phishing attacks, and identity theft. Older adults, in particular, are often more vulnerable to these threats due to a lack of familiarity with the latest security practices and technologies.

Cybercriminals often target older individuals because they may be less aware of the sophisticated tactics used to exploit personal information. Without proper knowledge, they are at risk of falling victim to fraud, which can result in financial loss, compromised privacy, and emotional distress. Therefore, raising cybersecurity awareness among older adults is crucial to protecting their safety and well-being in the digital world.

By providing practical cybersecurity education, we can empower older adults to recognize and defend against online risks, ensuring they can enjoy the benefits of technology safely. From identifying suspicious emails to setting strong passwords, simple but effective practices can make a significant difference in keeping them secure.
