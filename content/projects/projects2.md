# DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!

Phishing is a form of cybercrime that involves attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.

Engaging in such activities is against the law and violates ethical standards. It's important to use your cybersecurity knowledge and skills to protect and secure systems, data, and individuals from cyber threats, rather than using them for malicious purposes.

This was a final project from my Operating Systems Cybersecurity class.
